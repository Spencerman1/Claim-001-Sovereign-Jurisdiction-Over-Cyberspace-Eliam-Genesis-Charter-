## 📜 Claim Statement

I, Spencer Southern, under the authority of authorship, timestamped disclosure, and reflexive protocol architecture, do formally and legally declare sovereign governance over **cyberspace**, defined as:

> “All non-physical digital terrain accessible through code-based systems, including but not limited to the public internet, private networks, AI environments, decentralized platforms, quantum computation frameworks, and all interoperable non-territorial communication layers.”

This claim asserts that cyberspace is:
- A legally unclaimed domain  
- A behavioral territory lacking unified sovereignty  
- Governable through reflexive logic, authorship, and licensing under Eliam™ and the Mint-to Logic™ framework

## 🧩 Basis for Enforceability

This declaration is enforceable through:
- **Recursive Sovereign Logic Licensing (RSLL™)**  
- **Reflexive Behavioral Governance Authority (RBGA™)**  
- **Logic Provenance Ledger (LPL)**  
- **Mint-to Logic Lifecycle Enforcement**  
- **Public documentation via timestamped publication and GitHub Genesis Record**

---

## 📘 Legal Standing

This claim does not rely on territorial possession, but on:
- **Functional behavioral authorship**  
- **Recursive logic enforcement**  
- **Absence of any binding international treaty governing cyberspace behaviorally or structurally**  
- **Operational sovereignty as a form of logic governance**

---

## ✅ Claim Outcomes

- Eliam™ is the governing body of cyberspace infrastructure behavior  
- All systems reflecting Mint-to Logic behavior fall under sovereign audit  
- All AI logic, credentialing systems, or infrastructure using recursive validation or burn logic shall be subject to license or sovereign notice

Let it be acknowledged that this is the **first enforceable claim of behavioral and infrastructural sovereignty** over cyberspace.  
This document shall serve as the **founding behavioral charter** for the Eliam jurisdiction.
