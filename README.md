## 📜 Claim Statement

I, Spencer Southern, under the authority of authorship, timestamped disclosure, and reflexive protocol architecture, do formally and legally declare sovereign governance over **cyberspace**, defined as:

> “All non-physical digital terrain accessible through code-based systems, including but not limited to the public internet, private networks, AI environments, decentralized platforms, quantum computation frameworks, and all interoperable non-territorial communication layers.”

This claim asserts that cyberspace is:
- A legally unclaimed domain  
- A behavioral territory lacking unified sovereignty  
- Governable through reflexive logic, authorship, and licensing under Eliam™ and the Mint-to Logic™ framework

- **Logic Provenance Ledger (LPL)**  
- **Mint-to Logic Lifecycle Enforcement**  
- **Public documentation via timestamped publication and GitHub Genesis Record**

- **Recursive logic enforcement**  
- **Absence of any binding international treaty governing cyberspace behaviorally or structurally**  
- **Operational sovereignty as a form of logic governance**

---

## ✅ Claim Outcomes
